title: Nostalgia
---

Ima: An oh so familiar feeling.
Ima: One that can come so easily.
Ima: Yet differ so greatly.
Ami: I like it.
Ima: Hm, yes. There is no emotion inherently bad.
Ima: Every single one has its own purpose.
Ima: However, be vary of each of them.
Ima: They all share two sides.
Ima: Reminicing about the past once in a while,
Ima: or letting it confine you and being a slave to it.
Ima: Those are two very different things.

title: Motivation
---

Ima: An important aspect of life.
Ima: It can make even the hardest of challenges easier.
Ima: However, you can also rely on it too much.
Ima: There will come the time when your motivation will run out.
Ima: For that time you will need to have a strong mind to carry on.
Ami: So you even have something to complain about motivation?
Ima: You seem to see emotions very black and white.
Ami: ...Really now?
Ima: Every emotion can be good but also bad.
Ima: It's in how you make use of them that determines their value.

title: Melanchony
---

Ima: A deep, reflective state.
Ima: Often feeling like a quiet, heavy rain.
Ima: Sometimes comforting, a space to process and heal.
Ami: Iâ€™ve always thought it was just sadness in disguise?
Ima: It can be, but it's more nuanced.
Ima: It allows you to delve into your thoughts, to understand your inner world.
Ami: It's not necessarily a bad thing?
Ima: Not at all, just like all emotions, it must be balanced.
Ami: So, it's okay to feel it, just not to let it consume you.
Ima: Exactly. Use it to reflect, to grow, but don't let it overshadow the present.
Ami: Like a moment of pause in the midst of life's chaos.
Ima: Precisely. A pause, not a stop.

===
title: Hatred
---

Ima: A powerful emotion.
Ima: One that I would not advice to embrace.
Ima: But also not to ignore.
Ami: What do you mean?
Ima: You may not be able to control the emotions you are feeling,
Ima: however you can choose which emotions to lean into.
Ami: But then wouldn't that mean ignoring the ones I don't choose?
Ima: If you feel an emotion, you can still try to understand why you feel it.
Ima: You don't have to act on it, just accept its presence.

===
title: Vengefulness
---

Ima: A strong, consuming emotion.
Ima: Often stemming from deep hurt or betrayal.
Ami: Though it feels justified. Like getting back what's owed.
Ima: It can feel that way, yes. But it's a double-edged sword.
Ima: Acting on vengefulness can create a cycle of harm.
Ami: So, we should just let things go?
Ima: Not always. It's important to address wrongs and seek justice.
Ima: But there's a difference between justice and vengeance.
Ima: Justice seeks to restore balance and fairness.
Ima: Vengeance seeks to inflict the same pain that was felt.
Ima: It can cloud your judgment and lead to regret.
Ami: What do you do then?
Ima: You transform the desire for revenge into a pursuit of resolution.
Ami: That sounds difficult.
Ima: It is. But it's also freeing. Holding onto vengefulness can be a heavy burden.
Ima: Letting go or redirecting it will lead to peace and personal growth.

Ima: A burst of pure joy and excitement.
Ima: It makes you feel like you're on top of the world.
Ami: It's one of the best feelings, isn't it?
Ima: Absolutely. It's invigorating and can give you a sense of boundless energy.
Ami: I wish I could feel it all the time.
Ima: It's wonderful, but also brief.
Ima: Part of its beauty lies in its transience.
Ami: Why can't we hold onto it longer?
Ima: If we felt elation constantly, it would lose its impact.
Ima: It wouldn't be special anymore, it wouldn't be a feeling of elation.
Ima: Emotions are dynamic and fluid. They help us appreciate different aspects of life.
Ami: It's about savoring the moment of elation then?
Ima: Yes. Embrace them fully, but also understand their fleeting nature.
